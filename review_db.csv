0,Buffalo Games - Signature Collection - Cinque Terre - 1000 Piece Jigsaw Puzzle,920 customer reviews,"['While it is an intricate puzzle and takes a bit of time to complete, it is a beautiful high quality puzzle. I see many reviews that state ""pieces fit in the wrong places"". This is semi true... yes, pieces will often seem to fit well in more than one place, but there really is a way to double check if the placement is correct. Each horizontal and vertical cut of the puzzle is a continuous line from top to bottom and left to right. The edges of Each piece flow fluidly with its contiguous pieces. Pieces that are not perfect matches in height or width of the piece it attaches to is incorrectly placed. I hope that makes sense.\n', 'Same problem as other reviewers: pieces fit perfectly where they shouldn\'t, and often in the same color area. Two adults did this and we wound up with 25 pieces left over because some piece somewhere was in ""wrong"". Beautiful puzzle, fun to match up all of the tiny buildings and details, but maddening because we couldn\'t finish without examining every piece again.  Three stars for detail and quality of picture and puzzle - maybe others from this brand are okay? I\'m never going to try to find out.\n', ""I liked it. Beautiful picture. I didn't give 5 stars because several pieces came damaged. I am disappointed with that. But overall i am having fun playing with it.\n"", ""Other bad reviews are true. I went through at least 60 hours of work or more on this puzzle only to finally make it to the end and discover that it had two incorrect pieces that would not fit. I'm pissed. Seriously, how bad of a puzzle manufacturer do you have to be to consistently get this wrong? Are they high all day long?UPDATE: I returned it, got another, THERE IS STILL ONE PIECE MISSING!!!!  You had one job, Buffalo, one job, can you be anymore incompetent?UPDATE 2: Second one returned, another bought because it wouldn't just send another replacement. I am returning it YET AGAIN because the same piece is f'ing missing. I'm really pissed off at this point. This puzzle was for a filmed comedy sketch for YouTube and we're having an impossible time finishing it.\n"", ""Spectacularly beautiful photo of an obviously spectacularly beautiful place. It was a challenge to assemble because as others have noted you sometimes think you have found the right piece only to realize later that it wasn't the right piece afterall, but my wife and I liked doing it enormously and the end result is a stunning view of the Italian coast.  I didn't give the puzzle five stars because as others have also noted some of the pieces arrived bent or with the cardboard starting to separate.  This means that when the final puzzle is assembled it does not lie perfectly flat but has places here and there where bent or damaged bits are sticking up. See photo. That's a pity because otherwise it was a thorough delight to work on and, as I've said, incredibly beautiful.\n"", 'I liked the picture but the pieces are cheap and they often fit in places they should not.  Seriously how hard is it to design a jigsaw puzzle with actually unique pieces, I have never had this problem before.  Also the picture makes it look like there is more saturation and contrast variation in the sky and water than there actually is when looking at the pieces.  I would have been fine with this increased challenge had it been easy to discern whether or not the piece was in the right spot.  Even when they are in the right spot they often fit loosely and make you second guess yourself.\n', ""This was a very attactive picture and, since I had been here before, very nostasgic. The actual design is closer to a detailed painting than a photograph, but the Mediterranean really is as beautiful as this puzzle depicts.There was some minor separating of the edges of the pieces and one clear wrinkle, but let's be honest, you'll always get this as you sort pieces out and drop them in your couch only to sit on them later, accidentally. Then after accusing your significant other of hiding the last piece again so they get to 'finish' the puzzle themselves, you will eventually find that last piece, apologize profusely, and be able to stand back and admire the scenery. Enjoy!\n"", ""Good: this is a beautiful, difficult puzzle. The pieces often seem like they could go in multiple places which makes it harder and which we enjoy.Con: We received this puzzle in the fall, completed it, and found we were missing a piece. Got a replacement, and.... Missing another piece. Quality control is awful if I've received two separate 999 piece puzzles. Now I've got to reach out to Amazon because it took us too long to do the puzzle... Twice...Would not order from this company again. Sad, because it is a beautiful puzzle.\n"", ""The one star I gave it was for the beautiful picture.  I wish I would have read these reviews before purchasing.  I, too, am an avidpuzzler.  This is the first time EVER that I quit a puzzle.  So disappointing.  Too many pieces fit in the same spots, to the point where I'm looking at it through a magnifying glass to make sure it fits perfectly.  Not fun for me at all.\n"", 'The puzzle is not cut very well, but the worst part is that the puzzle I received was missing one piece but had two non-matching pieces.\n', 'This is a great puzzle! I thought it was going to be hard because the ocean was similar colors but it actually was not that difficult! There was enough variety that made it semi-easy to put together. This took me about a week and am very impressed with the colors of it. I put this together for my sister for Christmas and she hasn’t seen it yet but I’m sure she will love it too! As always, Buffalo game puzzles are great quality for the price! I recommend this puzzle and this brand I anyone who loves to do puzzles! There have been many people who say that there were damaged pieces, however that was not my experience. All of my pieces fit together well and made a beautiful finished product.\n', ""This was a very frustrating puzzle.  We had 2 missing pieces but that wasn't the worst of it.  Having done many puzzles I've never had one where the pieces were so similar it was possible to fit them in with all sides attached and have it fit.  This creates major issues later when you realize that you have some pieces in the wrong place and have to go looking for the error.  When it happens in an area like sky or rocks where there are literally 60-70  pieces that look almost exactly the same it really is a problem.  I will not be buying any puzzles from this manufacturer again.I should have read the reviews but it is a puzzle, how hard can it be for the company to do it right?  Wrong, as several have stated, the issues we have experienced are not at all unique to us.\n"", ""I love puzzles, but I threw this puzzle away.  Many of the pieces were cut the same size and shape so it was extremelydifficult to know which pieces were in the wrong place with all the colors of the sky and water.  Even the houses were similar in color and pieces that didn't belong fit.  I would suggest a different puzzle maker.\n"", ""This is a beautiful puzzle and well made.  No puzzle dust in the box, and no missing pieces.  You can tell by looking at the picture that it will be a challenging puzzle, which is why I purchased it.  Why would you buy a puzzle you can finish in one sitting.  The puzzle poster included was a real plus.  I will admit a few pieces were a bit damaged, but that's not unusual.  I found that it was pretty easy to tell if you had the wrong piece.  It would be just a little off.  That's part of the fun.\n"", ""My husband does a lot of puzzles, he's been doing them for years.  We thought this one would be challenging and it certainly was.  Not because of the degree of difficulty in the picture though but because it was missing pieces.  Additionally, many of the pieces were either duplicate pieces or cut so similar to others that you thought they fit in one place but then you realized that it couldn't be because the size of the outer dimension of the puzzle wasn't right.  I believe the puzzle was missing some pieces and had duplicates of others.  We then found out one of our relatives bought the same puzzle and had the same problem.  I would advise staying away from this brand as it appears they have a poor or non-existent quality control process.  We won't buy any puzzles made by Buffalo in the future.\n"", 'Have purchased several Buffalo Games puzzles (750 piececes) that were really great. However, this particular ""Signature"" puzzle came with several slightly damaged pieces and there were two pieces missing. The picture is amazing, but the quality of the materials used is poor. One of the missing pieces was an edge piece that could not be found from the beginning of putting the puzzle together (took my wife about 12 hours over two days for the entire puzzle). Mostly buy Springbok puzzles. Never been disappointed with them.\n', ""WHAT A PIECE OF TRASH!  NOT ONLY DO THE PIECES FIT LOOSELY--SO YOU CAN'T REALLY TELL IF YOU HAVE THE RIGHT PIECES INTERLOCKED, BUT THERE WAS SO MUCH TRASH/TRIMMINGS FROM THE PUZZLE BEING CUT THAT IT WAS A MESS TO CLEAN UP BEFORE EVEN PUTTING THE PIECES OUT ON THE TABLE.FORGET THIS BRAND!  MUCH BETTER PUZZLE IS SUNSOUT INC BRAND\n"", 'liked the high quality pieces, all there and accounted for, only one piece didnt sit flat in place. we read tons of your reviews before purchasing this and passed on others based on reviews. got for Christmas and just finished tonight, so it took two half days/evenings to put together. this was second most difficult jigsaw puzzle we ever did. a hanful of pieces technically ""can"" fit in more than one place so you have to be careful. its like sudoku in that some moves seem right but theres only one correct position for each piece.  and the ""s"" shaped sides are annoying. the colors on ours are sharp and vivid. buffalo makes great puzzles so we looked past some negative reviews and we were glad we did. if something isnt up to quality then send back for another.\n', ""I bought this because I love the picture.  We completed this after many, many hours only to find that about 10 pieces do not fit or the right pieces fit elsewhere.  I don't see how you can make a puzzle with this complication.  There is something completely wrong with not being able to complete a puzzle that you have worked so many hours.DO NOT BUY THIS PUZZLE!\n"", ""This puzzle is beautiful and the quality is excellent. My one gripe is that several of the pieces are apparently identical in shape and so close in color that they seemed to fit in a spot perfectly...until we discovered that another piece didn't fit anywhere EXCEPT that already-occupied spot. This made the puzzle much trickier than it had to be, but if you love difficult puzzles, then that's just a bonus!Five stars for the quality of the puzzle and the beauty of the image. Three for the frustration factor inherent in the cut of the pieces. So the average of the two earns this puzzle four stars overall.\n"", 'I bought the 2000 piece version of this puzzle previously and found it a bit overwhelming given the size of the pieces and the size of the finished product (nearly 40"" wide).  I thought I would try the 1000 piece version as I have built several other puzzles with this number of pieces.  Buffalo makes fine pieces in both cases and they are roughly the same size with the 2000 and 1000 versions (the 1000 piece version is much smaller, about 26 inches wide, when finished).  You clearly know if you have the right piece or not 99% of the time.  The same cannot be said of other manufacturers.  I found the 1000 piece version more to my liking as I was able to complete it more quickly.  Very brilliant colors in this particular puzzle and clearly the best of about seven different puzzles of the same town in Italy that are for sale.  They increased the color intensity and saturation to get the almost-unreal colors for this version, but I like it and it looks great when done.\n', 'This puzzle is of medium difficulty, largely due to two things. One is the vibrant and varied colors, and the other is the sharpness of the photo. It\'s HD and sharp from foreground to infinity. I did have a bit of a challenge with the sky after I got the skyline and sunset done, but when I finished the rest of the puzzle, I turned it around so the sky was next to me, and finished it quickly.The pieces are the standard bump-hole, with 1 to 4 bumps or holes each, and an occasional piece with a wavy side. They\'re obviously similar, but distinctive enough most of the time, though occasionally I would put the wrong one, and it seemed to work, until I tried putting pieces next to it. Sometimes this had to be corrected.I loved this puzzle for the vibrant colors, and the little details on the porches like lawn chairs. It was great fun to do, with very little frustration. I\'m giving most of my puzzle collection away, but I will keep this one. And it is always great to be able to ""travel"" to interesting places I can\'t afford to visit in person.\n', 'This is the first puzzle of done that I actually returned. It is very frustrating because pieces would fit in places that they weren’t supposed to. I like a challenging puzzle but I got so angry at it it was ridiculous. I agree with another reviewer that the puzzles need to be a little bit more unique so they don’t fit in multiple places\n', 'My wife and I love puzzles and almost always have one in progress. I gave her this one for a Christmas present because we loved the Cinque Terre image.HOWEVER, the pieces are all basically the same shape, so you have to really look to find the minute differences that place the piece. Worse, the pieces are not accurately cut. There was one edge piece that fit, sort of, but the edge was not in alignment. In another solid color area, the only piece that would possibly fit in the single remaining space, would NOT fit. We spent a couple of hours on it and took it apart and will trash it. Further, the pieces do not interlock well, so slight movement will cause the assembled pieces to come apart. We will stick with Springbok.\n', 'I ordered this puzzle because I like photos of Cinque Terre.The issue with this puzzle is quality.  The thickness of the pieces is inconsistent.  Some are a lot thinner than others, to the point that pressure will break the piece.Worse, the interlock between the pieces is very poor.  A lot of the pieces will  fit in the wrong place, and since the quality of the photo is mediocre at best, it makes putting the puzzle together practically impossible.Not sure if this is true of all Signature Collection, but I would avoid this puzzle, and go with a Ceaco brand\n', ""I am really pleased with this puzzle.  The scene is just gorgeous.  This little village (Manarola, Italy) is one I've visited and this brings back good memories.  The criticism that the pieces seem to fit in more than one place is valid.  You just have a be very careful to ensure that the piece lines up right with adjacent pieces and check to see if there's any separation between them.  If you can hold two pieces interlocked up to the light and see any light coming through, it's almost certainly not the right two pieces. There were a few pieces that also arrived with bent edges and this is why I'm giving a 4-star review.  Other than that, this is a really good, fun, and beautiful puzzle.UPDATE upon completion: Counter to what others have expressed, my puzzle included all pieces. None missing, no extras.\n"", ""AMAZING puzzle.  Extremely good quality construction and feel, crisp interaction between pieces, beautiful color reproduction and detail.  It's harder than expected too; some of the pieces have VERY subtle differences, so be prepared to stop and recheck your previous work when you find a piece that just won't fit, because it probably belongs where you placed another piece already and didn't notice it not fitting together exactly right.This is the best puzzle I've worked in a long time.  I will ABSOLUTELY buy more Buffalo puzzles after doing this one.  I couldn't recommend this one more highly.\n"", ""SO BUMMED. 2 of the pieces didn't fit even though it's clear that where they belong. How that happens who knows??? Then we were missing a piece.\n"", ""Beautiful puzzle and the puzzle was well made.  Cinque Terre is beautiful and the image used for this puzzle reflects that.  A couple weeks after finishing it, we picked up a cheaper puzzle (made by Eurographics) at the grocery store and there is a noticeable difference in the build quality, the pieces in the one we just bought don't fit together well and feel light and cheap, a stark contrast to the quality pieces of this puzzle.  Will make sure the next one we buy is from Buffalo Games or another quality company.  I had no idea there was that much of a difference between cheap puzzles and better made ones but it's definitely not worth saving a few bucks.\n"", ""This is a real review! I believe I've spotted some one star duplicates on other buffalo products and wanted to let everyone know that not true in my case.  No missing pieces, no bent or damaged pieces. This was my first undertaking of any puzzle and although 1000 pieces seemed like a lot at first it was a fun and challenging puzzle. There were a few pieces that fit together too easy in places they didn't belong but that was part of the challenge. I'm ordering another from them for sure.\n"", ""This was a beautiful puzzle and very challenging.  However, after spending hours and hours putting it together, I found that two pieces were missing, so that it could not be kept or framed.  After checking with Buffalo Games' website and Amazon, I found I could not get the missing pieces.  Buffalo would only send me a new puzzle, and could not guarantee that the missing pieces would fit the one I had--so who wants to put the whole thing together I again.  I opted just to return it to Amazon for a refund.\n"", ""Frustrating puzzle!I did all edge pieces first only to find out I had two areas reversed. They looked perfect but when I looked at picture I realized that were wrong.This happened time and again. If you didn't make sure that they for perfectly the whole puzzle would be off.We had many mistakes that caused us to search for pieces that simply were not there until we looked closer and Re-fit then together properly. They would look like they fit just fine.I finished the panne and had one piece left that did not fit into any of the 3 available spaces. (I have a dog....so I'll take blame for missing two pieces)Puzzle is beautiful but was difficult and frustrating.Would never buy this brand again.We are used to Ravensburger brand.\n"", ""Didn't like the cut of the pieces.  Wrong pieces seem to fit together just as well as the correct one, it was very strange, you wouldn't realize until later why parts of your puzzle weren't coming together like they should and then you had to go back and try and figure out what the problem was.  Everyone in my family who attempted it eventually gave up and lost interest in it, eventually we accepted that no one was gonna keep working on it and it went unfinished back into the box.\n"", ""Beautiful picture but as others have commented the pieces are far too similar in shape and size. There are sections of this puzzle that are so difficult to solve that it is rendered not fun and quite exhaustive. The reason is many pieces can go in many different locations. Well, this wouldn't be an issue of the color of each piece were different. But in certain areas of the puzzle, such as the sky and sea, there is no discernible difference in the colors of the pieces. All you can go off is the shape. And as I said there are pieces that fit in many different spots. So you just don't know if you have found the one true spot for those pieces. Along the top right of the puzzle the straight edge seemed unsolvable for me and my wife. The easiest part of a puzzle is the edge and we couldn't do the top right edge. If this picture were different and it didn't have enormous areas of purple and blue I'd rate the puzzle higher. We gave up at about 80% complete and that's not a fun feeling.\n"", ""I do many puzzles lately and love a challenge.  This puzzle is disappointing due to 2 things.  1) Piece size is too small.  You should not need a  magnifying glass to study each piece.  I don't have to scrutinize pieces from other puzzles like this one requires.  2) Pieces fit in WRONG PLACES.  Seriously, I have not had this difficulty on other puzzles.  The wrong piece fits in the wrong place constantly.  Again, you have to get out a magnifying glass to study the lines between the pieces to see if it is correct.  Totally frustrating, if I was not stubborn this would be in the trash already.\n"", 'The pieces are not cut correctly. Some would fit together perfectly when it was clear the colors were off.We threw the puzzle away out of frustration.The picture is stunning, but the puzzle is annoying due to the cut. We would literally have to examine pieces multiple times to see if they were in fact correct.The kicker, one piece that had to go in one spot did not fit. The cut was just off, but this was the only place for it to go and it would not fit.\n', ""1000 piece puzzle is going to be hard no matter what but this puzzle has way to many pieces that fit when they shouldn't!  It's very frustrating to realize that a piece that fits perfectly doesn't really belong where you put it. It seems that there are way to many pieces that are the exact same shape & size!!! Everyone trying to help put this puzzle together got frustrated & eventually went away.\n"", 'Pieces fit together nicely and puzzle is very sturdy.  Only negative thing is that some of the pieces have an S-shaped connection instead of the typical key-hole connection which resulted in some pieces fitting in more than one place.  It was tricky because in some of the places the colors were closely matched and it was hard to tell that we had place a piece in the wrong position.  We worked this as a family - my husband, our 14-yr-old son, our 11-yr-old son, and me.  Previously, we had thought that we would only purchase Ravensburger puzzles because of the quality of the puzzle pieces, but now we are Buffalo fans.  The quality is comparable, the price is cheaper, and the poster is a HUGE help!\n', ""This is an extremely hard puzzle because so much of the land, buildings, water and sky look alike. I'm spending most of my time with about 200 pieces of near identical shades of color trying to figure out how they go. About as frustrating as a pure white puzzle with no picture. The other problem is, lots of the pieces will randomly fit together and are close in color and you have to look with just about a magnifying glass to see that it's the wrong piece.None of my pieces were damaged and the picture itself is beautiful and the pieces seem thick and high quality. But this is a very hard puzzle and I see it taking me a month or more (that's if my kid or my cats don't eat a random piece before I can get it finished.)*update* July 10th - so I'm down to less than 20 pieces to match. I'm very obviously missing pieces and discovering especially in the blue parts many pieces either don't fit right or are too close to fitting like others so getting one wrong throws off the entire puzzle.I'm missing one piece in the houses and it seems like I have extra sky pieces. Very disappointed. This took so long to put together, now I can't even return it.*update* July 16th - I sent Buffalo Games a support ticket asking if I could get a replacement, or a credit or something because of the missing pieces and they've just ignored me. So I won't be buying anymore items from Buffalo Games and could never recommend them.\n"", 'Very challenging puzzle, but also very fun! Took almost a month to finish working a few times a week for 20 to 30 minutes each time. It was a relaxing and rewarding experience. Pieces were well made and sturdy. The puzzle was beautiful once finished, and best of all, ALL 1000 OF THE PIECES WERE ACTUALLY THERE! The last few puzzles I purchased were all missing pieces. Nothing more frustrating than finishing a puzzle and having missing pieces. I will be purchasing from this puzzle company again. Very satisfied!\n', ""This should receive 0 Stars. Pay heed to the poor reviews and don't waste your money like I did. This is the worst puzzle I have ever seen or attempted.Many pieces are delaminating, they fit together poorly, many pieces can be placed in several different positions perfectly. Also, the pieces that do fit together correctly don't fit that tight and if you bump or move the puzzle it comes apart too easily. Just a low quality cheaply made product in comparison to every other puzzle I've ever done.\n"", ""I'm giving up on this puzzle!!  I've spent days trying to figure out where pieces fit as many other reviewer have mentioned.  What is the fun in that.  Its not relaxing which is the whole point for me.  Kudos for you with the patience to check the fit by lifting to the light or examining the edges closely.  BTW, I still love puzzling.\n"", 'I just finished this puzzle after ordering it almost two months ago, which is great. It’s a challenge which is what I wanted, HOWEVER it’s mossing a piece. This is the second puzzle in a row from buffalo games that was! It’s been too long for me to return this one, but I’m a little sad.I have another puzzle downstairs from this company, if it’s missing one as well I’ll never be ordering from them again\n', 'Bought this without reading reviews. Should have read them. Puzzle missing 4 pieces, and some pieces are interchangeable, they fit perfectly to wrong piece so it took forever figure it out and fix it. Specifically the solid purple edge. Good luck with that! This was my first Buffalo puzzle and not a good experience. However, I bought a second one and have no complaints! I didn’t return this puzzle or try to get a refund.\n', ""This was a tough puzzle, however I thoroughly enjoyed it. The colors are extremely vivid and you will need to use them to solve the puzzle. I was impressed with the quality of the pieces, and the thickness of the puzzle. The only reason I didn't give this puzzle five stars was some of the puzzle pieces are so similar they fit where they aren't supposed to. This happened to me about 4 times during the puzzle, and while I finished a color section and I realized I must have an error somewhere, I found it, it was challenging.I already have purchased another Buffalo Games Puzzle!\n"", ""It ended up being a fairly ambitious puzzle for the first attempt that either my husband or I had made at a puzzle in 10 years or more.  However, we were looking for something to do for New Year's Eve and liked the fact that this reminded us of our trip to Cinque Terre.  Needless to say, it took FAR longer than a single evening.  However, by the time we finished it almost two weeks later, we had the pride of completing it AND a beautiful puzzle.  And no missing pieces!\n"", 'I love this puzzle and am so glad I found this source for puzzles!

I would definitely recommend this for puzzle enthusiasts!\n', 'This is the 3rd replacement, very disappointed with the product. The first 2 had missing pieces of the puzzle and 2 xtra pieces that did not belong to this puzzle. After the 2nd replacement, I followed the instructions to send back with a replacement no questions asked, never arrived. I also called the 800 number which puts you directly into voicemail. I left 2 messages within the same week NO ONE ever called me back. After 60 hours of putting this puzzle together I was determined to find the missing pieces. I paid for a 3rd puzzle and I was able to find the missing pieces, did not match perfectly ( I knew this was expecteds, I was not going to start ALL over again),  but enough so I was able to finally glue the puzzle together. I would not recommend Buffalo games, there is something seriously wrong with this incompetent company..

Not looking to forward to finishing it, as the first day, I realized one of the border pieces was not in the box. I have gone through the box, piece by piece, three times before I dumped the whole thing out and checked a few more times. I’m left wondering if there are more pieces missing, and if it’s even worth finishing.  And other reviewers are correct, its very easy to put the wrong piece in the wrong spot. Pieces are easily interchangeable, until they are not.\n', 'This puzzle is horrible! There are nearly unlimited number of pieces that fit each spot. And none of them fit tightly. If you are looking for a puzzle that has a large number of solid color pieces that can be arranged in multiple ways before the “correct” order is found. This one is for you. Otherwise it is a headache waiting to happen. Sad poor cut out design on a rather pretty picture.\n', 'After doing MANY large puzzles this one takes the cake! It ""ain\'t"" worth the hassle. The pieces are too similar in their cuts, parts of pictures significantly unhelpful in offering sufficient clues to make the final stages of struggle worth it. After many hours of switching pieces around trying to find the ""right"" fit we were left with a piece that had no business in the single space left. With final dissatisfaction with it, we just turned it over and it fit ""perfectly."" In general, pieces that fit together don\'t stay together until in tight place--don\'t lock together. Boo!--knock apart easily--especially the zig-zag cuts.  Pictures are pretty but the puzzle itself isn\'t fun to figure out. We felt buffaloed! Bye bye Buffalo!\n', 'Really enjoyed this puzzle. Quality is great, coloring looks just as advertised. Definitely a challenging puzzle as there are several pieces that seem to be able to fit in multiple places. Depending on the difficulty level you are looking for would just keep that in mind. It was more challenging than my typical level, but I liked the challenge and felt more accomplished at the end. Excited to pass it on to my family members for them to enjoy as well.\n', ""I got all the pieces out. Couldn't find one border piece anywhere, then wasted a lot of time because pieces fit together to another piece that wasn't really the right one. I had to put what I had put together on top of a white sheet of paper and shine a bright light on it to determine my errors. I have never had a puzzle have so many similar connection possibilities, so close that I had difficulty discerning that they were even wrong. I finally put it all back in the box! Don't buy this unless you want hours of frustration!\n"", 'The picture is good quality but NOT the pieces. I started by putting the frame together and with almost every piece that connects to another there is a strong doubt as to whether they actually fit together or not. I ended up having to hold the fitted pieces up to the light to judge if it was a go or a no go. Terrible quality. Sent to back even though I adored the picture of Cinque Terre.\n', ""I'd really give it closer to a 2 1/2 stars but didn't have that option. I've done many other puzzles with a similar degree of difficulty and have not been frustrated. I'm still working on this puzzle although I've frequently thought of giving up. The problem is the pieces are all cut too similarly within the same area. Therefore, multiple pieces fit in multiple spots (in close proximity). I can't tell you how many times I've had to try different arrangements - even with the edge pieces!! Sections I knew had to go in an area (i.e. the pink part of the sky) wouldn't fit but then I'd switch the entire section with another section only 2-3 pieces away and it fit. Bottom line is too many pieces have the same shape (or nearly identical shape) as other pieces within the same area and the color variations are not sharp enough to discern the correct placement without frequent puzzle piece switches.\n"", 'We love a good challenge and this puzzle poses quite a challenge, even for an experienced puzzling family. We enjoyed putting this together and really liked the finished product.

The company includes a large picture of the puzzle in the box which is extremely helpful as you're putting it together. The puzzle is challenging.

I would definitely purchase from this company again.\n"", 'I liked making this puzzle, unfortunately I lost a piece. I wonder if you need to buy a whole new puzzle or have individual pieces ordered? Probably the former option is more realistic.\n', ""As noted by other reviewers, there are puzzle pieces that fit in more than one location.  I thought it was just reviewers being picky....but it is a problem.  Very frustrating when the background is one color like water or the night sky and a piece will seemingly fit and you end up having to take sections apart to get it right.  Maybe some people enjoy that challenge, but I do not.The detail on some of the pieces wasn't very sharp.  Grasses or brush pieces didn't really come together well when details were blurry.  Combine that with seemingly interchangeable pieces, makes for a less than enjoyable experience.I love the picture, not sure I'll buy another puzzle from this manufacturer though.\n"", 'The puzzle was hard. I mean it has 1000 tiny pieces what do you expect? Everyone who said pieces similarly fit when they don’t go together is right. But It’s 1000 pieces, it’s hard.

So you find out that the top row is all wrong based on how the second row doesn\'t fit. So then you move onto the 3rd row - where the patterned pieces start AND THAT DOESN""T FIT WITH THE TOP TWO ROWS.

This is one of those puzzles that went from one assembly to the donation pile.  It's challenging enough to put together because of the intricacies of the picture and small pieces without complicating the matter by using interchangeable pieces.  Many of the pieces are cut with little or no differences to them and when working with the sometimes indistinct color/pattern changes it's very easy to put pieces where they don't belong.  This leads to a lot of frustration in trying to complete the puzzle.  I'm not sure why some puzzles are so badly engineered.  This one could have been greatly improved by slightly enlarging the pieces and adding crisper, more distinct shapes to pieces in each similarly colored area.\n"", ""This was a Christmas gift, and I thoroughly enjoyed building it!  Yes, I had a few times where I put a piece somewhere and later figured out it was in the wrong spot, as others have mentioned.

It rips the storage container for my puzzles. Also, please cut your puzzles with a better puzzle template... so many of the pieces almost fit, but don't, you have to flip the pieces over and see if it actually fits.

I have done some other buffalo puzzles with pieces that were similar but this one had way too many especially considering the small size of the pieces.

The pieces are poorly designed, so some pieces will fit even though they should not go together. I spent about 30 minutes just reorganizing an edge I had completed because some of the pieces were out of order and it wasn't clear which ones. Much of this seems to be a result of the fact that even the pieces that do fit together fit so loosely that even a minor nudge will split them apart.

It occasionally became frustrating because of there being more than one way to fit some pieces together. The fit was exceptional and I learned to trust that there were only ""perfect fits"" between pieces. I had to scrap areas and start over a few times but that was part of the challenge and charm. There were three pieces that were slightly torn or buckled so I cannot in good conscience give five stars.

I know I could not of lost 6 pieces....I live alone and have a designated puzzle room....I took it from the box and laid it on the table....no way I lost those pieces.

Now all we need are frames to fit. *wink wink* that don't cost 40+ $$My photo does it no justice. I'll try to get a better one.\n"", 'We worked on this puzzle for almost a week.  When we got close to the end, we found that the puzzle had 10 pieces missing but we only had 9 pieces in hand.  The disappointing part was that none of these pieces went in the remaining holes.  After all the work we did to solve the puzzle, having the wrong pieces remaining is a major disappointment!More than happy to talk with someone regarding this!  See Pink circles for holes.\n', 'Aimee Stewart is one of my favorite puzzle artists; and Buffalo Games makes my favorite puzzles because they include a poster from which to work.  My favorite Aimee Stewart puzzles are from the ""Life is an Open Book"" collection but the Family series is fun too.  This one was especially fun.  Husband and I both enjoyed it.\n', 'I would have given this puzzle five stars because it is well-made and was super fun to put together but two of the pieces didn’t fit. In any way, shape or form. They matched the puzzle and were the right color but the cut outs were completely off. I cannot tell you how disappointing it is to put 1000 piece puzzle together and have the last two pieces not fit.\n', ""Aimee Stewart can pack anything and EVERYthing into a single small puzzle!  How many raccoons are there?  How many things are there that are more or less the same shade of blue?  The messiest campsite I've ever seen, but much more fun to have in a puzzle than in real life.  The only thing missing is the people!\n"", 'I really the design especially graphic looks high quality. I have been buying this brand from difference places. This time I decided to get from Amazon so I thought is would be the same quality, sadly it is not. If you buy from other retail store you would not have any issue with missing pieces. It is impossible to count them all before assemble. Looks to me amazon is trying to sell Manufacture defected kit with lower price.\n', 'This puzzle was fun to put together. No misses pieces like previous reviewers mentioned. The box was glued on all sides upon receipt, probably to prevent any pieces from escaping during shipment. The puzzle came with a poster which I used to help put together the edge pieces. After that, I put the poster aside and put it together without looking at the picture. It was fun and challenging, but not discouraging, because there are so many different colors, textures, and design elements in this picture, that I could always find a spot to make progress if I got stuck somewhere else. Enjoyed it so much I just ordered another from this same company & artist. Worth it!!\n', ""I love Aimee Stewart puzzles.  There are a lot of little details and funny little surprises in the puzzle.  It's challenging, but you want to keep going because it's almost like a complete story coming together.  You can tell she puts a lot of thought into her puzzles.  Very different from the ones we worked when I was growing up.  When you get closer to the end, it goes faster.\n"", 'fun puzzle, if you are looking for a crazy random fun puzzle this is a great option.10/10 would recommend\n', ""Fastest 1000 piece puzzle I've ever done!Plus: came with larger reference picture in the box (yay), very colorful and interesting.Okay: Pieces were thin, all pieces are square variations (no crazy cut pieces like some other brands, too bad).It was incredibly fast because of image, as you can figure out where individual pieces go pretty easily.\n"", 'So far this is a very nice puzzle. Not as high of a quality as some I have purchased but nice anyway. The biggest problem I have with it is that there was no poster sent with it. It is very difficult to determine what some of the pieces are by looking at the rather small picture on the box! You have to use a magnifying glass!\n', 'This puzzle was fun for three obsessed puzzlers and we knocked it out in a day. At that point only one piece had the picture layer lifting off the chipboard layer. When I disassembled it (fully expecting to keep it to do again) whole sections lifted off the chipboard. In the end there were so many damaged pieces I just threw the whole thing in the recycling bin. I’ve never had this happen and it’s definitely making me rethink the other puzzles from this brand that I have saved on my shopping list.\n', 'This was a fun puzzle and a lot harder than it looks.  Most of the images are very small (i.e. only on 2-3 puzzle pieces) so you have to refer to the image on the box frequently.  It kind of feels like your working on an ""I Spy"" puzzle because you have to search for the items among the many, many items in the puzzle.  :)The only downside to the puzzle is often pieces that don\'t go together actually fit together.  We had to rearrange multiple pieces we thought we had right the first time, when the surrounding pieces didn\'t fit.  Not a huge deal breaker but it definitely made it more challenging.\n', 'Our family of eight, ages 6-42, enjoyed working on this over the course of a week. We love how the pieces were tricky at times, seeming to fit where they didn’t, but it was easy to figure out as the puzzle came together. The colors were vibrant and the scene tickled all of us.\n', ""This was a great puzzle until the end when the last 3 pieces were the wrong shape to complete the puzzle.  I have never had this happen before.They were the right color and it wasn't that I had put the pieces in another place as they were the wrong shape so couldn't replace any pieces I took out.  :(\n"", 'Beautiful picture, vibrant colors.  Great puzzle for the family that enjoys going on adventures with the RV.  However, one piece was missing.  Otherwise, I’d have given this a 5 star review.

Every single piece was cut well, none were bent, and they fit together perfectly. Plus, there wasn't any puzzle dust! LOVED doing this one!\n"", 'Like:1. Vivid Colors2. Interesting pictures make puzzle fun to assemble.3. Fun activity as a family.4. Really helpful to have a poster to use as a guide.Dislike:1. Easy to fit wrong pieces together.2.

However, the last two we bought have had a missing piece.  Which as you can imagine is very frustrating when you are trying to complete the puzzle and you can’t find the piece and not be able to complete it. After, the second time this occurred to us, I’m really considering not ordering anymore from this company/brand.\n', ""We like Aimee Stewart puzzles and enjoyed her 'Open Book' series.This puzzle was fun in content & colors.

3,Buffalo Games - Darrell Bush - Canoe Lake - 1000 Piece Jigsaw Puzzle,304 customer reviews,"['When I started sorting out the edge pieces and found the 4 corners, and realized two were duplicate pieces, I had a very bad feeling about this puzzle.By the time we put the last piece in place, we were staring at a comical moth eaten tapestry of a picture...a grand total of 129 pieces of the puzzle were missing.  In an ironic addition of insult to injury there were 8 pieces in the box that were duplicates of others.  It might have made some kind of twisted mathematical sense if that still didn\'t leave 121 pieces unaccounted for if you were only going by raw numbers...but the box promised 1000 pieces and it did not deliver.I\'m not sure how this happens.  I\'d assume that at any reputable puzzle factory, the One Commandment would be ""put all the pieces in every box""...not ""put most of the pieces in...and sweep up whatever you find on the floor"".Considering the hours you have to invest in a 1000 piece puzzle, running out of pieces before you finish is more than a little disappointing.  In all honesty, I won\'t be buying another puzzle from Buffalo Games.\n', 'Have been putting puzzles together for years but have to say this was by far the most disappointing.  It absolutely does NOT have pieces that ""snap"" together as advertised.  So many of the pieces seem like they fit but are not really correct.  Too frustrating.  This one is going right into the donations bin.  I noticed too that the seller mentioned ""minimum dust"" which was also very untrue!  That was not the deal breaker for me though.  Just wish they could have been honest.  Will definitely not be purchasing another Buffalo puzzle.\n', ""Good fun puzzle but I didn't love the pieces and their fit.  Because the shapes are so similar I often found pieces that fit together but were incorrect.  Then they would get stuck together.  This was to the extent that I would often find pieces wrongly assembled that I had done earlier, all the way up to the last piece.  Still a good puzzle and that is why I gave it 4 stars but I don't think I'll buy another Buffalo puzzle.I really enjoy the sunsout puzzles.  Unique pieces make it fun.\n"", 'The puzzle was opened. Its missing 76 pieces out of 1000 pieces. It took us 45 minutes to count and recount it !!.\n', ""We bought this puzzle a week ago and worked all week to finish. Loved the way it looked and were excited to hopefully frame it when we were done. However, we got to the very end and we were missing 2 puzzle pieces. We don't have dogs or kids and the puzzle stayed on the kitchen table all week so had to be an error on the company's side. Pretty disappointed to not get to truly finish the puzzle!\n"", ""I bought this for a friend for Christmas because we both love puzzles and they have a lake they want to build a cabin on. When it came in the mail the box was dented on the corner like it was dropped and it was really tiny. It was small enough to fit in my mailbox. I have puzzles from different companies and the boxes are pretty. This one I don't feel thrilled to give as a gift. If my friend was as picky as me I'd send it back but I know she will love the picture. I just hope all the pieces are there!\n"", ""Awesome puzzle! I bought it is a Christmas present for my husband and we just finished it, BUT one piece of the puzzle is missing (tree trunk) which I was really disappointed in. I scoured everywhere in my kitchen thinking that maybe we lost it, but I haven't found it anywhere. I had seen from another reviewer that they were missing one piece of their puzzle and I thought, nah, that couldn't happen to me.  Ha! Anyway, it's a great puzzle. Very detailed and the separate picture of the puzzle really helped as a guide.\n"", ""The puzzle was interesting to put together. I do agree with the person who said that there were pieces so similar that you later realized that they had to be removed and swapped with other pieces.  This was true with the straight edge pieces as well.  When you tried to remove pieces it was difficult and they had to be twisted out. The puzzle was not made out of the most sturdy cardboard and there wasn't the feel of pieces snapping in. The biggest criticism is that there was one piece missing that we realized early on was gone. But we kept on playing!.With that said the upside was that it was a good challenge and the picture was interesting. I would likely buy another.\n"", 'I set this out on the coffee table for my family to put together during the holidays. We\'re about half way finished with it. It is a fairly difficult puzzle in that the pieces don\'t ""lock"" until you have a large area completed. I always put the border pieces together first. So, until I get several pieces attached to the border, it doesn\'t stay in place very well and will come apart easily. Also, it is very easy to put the wrong piece in a position because the pieces fit fairly loosly in the notches. So, I have spent some time back tracking to figure out where the wrong piece is, even though the colors look like a near perfect match. This simply adds to the difficulty of the puzzle, but can be a bit frustrating when you finish a fairly large area, then realize something isn\'t right and have to figure it out. I love working on jigsaw puzzles, so the above comments aren\'t necessarily negative unless you are a person who likes to work puzzles quickly and don\'t have the patience for the time it takes to correct errors. Overall, the puzzle has been a huge hit and I love the scene on it!\n', 'When the puzzle was ""finished"" five pieces didn\'t fit anywhere! Disappointing when you work on a puzzle for weeks.\n', 'It was a very fun puzzle. It had its easy parts and it had its very hard parts. A nice variety of challenges and rewards. The theme elicited many fun conversations with my wife, my co-puzzler, even to the extent of probably doing a mini-vacation this spring in a similar setting. The puzzle pieces were durable, only fit well when correct, with many ""almost correct but not"" pieces, and stayed together better than many other brands.  I have since ordered another puzzle from the same manufacture.\n', 'This is the worst 1000 piece puzzle I’ve ever attempted.  I’ve done puzzles for years and this one has several parts that are too muddy to differentiate, plus the shape of the puzzle pieces are too similar to know one is making a mistake, especially in these dark areas.  I am far enough along now with the completion of the puzzle that the last pieces should be identified easily, but this has not been the case.  The most frustrating and disappointing puzzle I’ve ever attempted, and 1000 is usually my preferred level of difficulty.\n', ""My girlfriend paid 50 cents for a 1000 piece puzzle that I helped her with a few weeks ago. It was a lot of fun. When I could see it was about done I surprised her with this top rated puzzle, thinking it would be better and instead, it was a let down. Two big reasons I will avoid this puzzle maker like the plague in the future. The first is the pieces are very much alike in size and shape. The first puzzle I mentioned had a lot more variety so it allowed you to search for a very unique shape and I am pretty good at that. The second is the fit is poor. You can't put one or more pieces together and even pick it up and move it on a table as they are too loose. Very disappointing. The best part is the color and intensity of the puzzle, but while that is much appreciated, I would rate it as a difficult puzzle and I am surprised the reviews did not mention these things.\n"", 'This is a very tough puzzle. The pieces are of medium to low strength.  We are not huge puzzle people and I think that it would have been better to do an easier one. That being said, the colors are very pretty. There were about 4 pieces that were coming apart, we just needed to be super careful with those pieces.\n', 'All the pieces were present.  Above average difficulty due to two things:  1) the design has large areas of similarly colored sky and water, and 2) the pieces would sometimes have a false-positive fit -- that is, I would sometimes put two pieces together that were a false but very nearly correct fit.  Still, that only added to the challenge -- I eventually discovered all the spots where I had put the wrong pieces together, and I swapped in the right pieces with great satisfaction.  So five stars.  Happy with the purchase.\n', 'I buy a lot of puzzles, this one however I had issues with. There were several pieces that could fit in multiple places. I know it sounds weird and this is the first one that has happened to me. It was very frustrating. But finally got it together and the picture looked nice.\n', 'We did this puzzle as an office engagement project. It took our office about a week to complete the puzzle all to find out we were missing one piece.  We had fun with the puzzle, but wished we were able to finish it.  Hopefully, Buffalo Games will check the boxes to make sure all the pieces are in the box.  It really is a beautiful puzzle, just wished we could have finished it so we can frame the puzzle.\n', 'Was fun putting this puzzle together only to get to the end and find 5 pieces missing.

6,Buffalo Games - Charles Wysocki - Moonlight & Roses - 1000 Piece Jigsaw Puzzle,144 customer reviews,"['Welp, another ""value"" puzzle to work on. Scouring Amazon for low-priced or on sale 1,000 piece puzzles, I came across this one. Hey, when you have an addiction, you can\'t be picky.Turns out, I shouldn\'t have been concerned. The puzzle ended up being highly entertaining, despite the rather bland scene depicted. Since a good part of the puzzle enjoyment is wrapped up in the solving, the picture was really the only thing that was less than superb here.Okay, the basics:It\'s a Buffalo Games puzzle. That means quality construction, sound machining, internal poster and reasonably low puzzle dust. Buffalo puzzles are almost always top tier in quality. Plus, they are always ""snug"" fits, allowing you to work small sections and move them without the pieces falling off.The ""how did I solve it"" section:I like to read how others solve puzzles and I like to share my own ""techniques"". I came into this puzzle with a bit of trepidation - there did not appear to be any clear ""quick solve"" area. So, I went big. I attacked the colorful sky, all the way to the dull grays. Once I finished, I realized I had really taken out a lot of the puzzle. Emboldened, I hit up the houses, then the grounds, the waters, and finally the mountains and the trees. Done and done.It\'s a Buffalo puzzle, so you know it will be fun. In my case, more fun than I expected.\n', ""This puzzle was a real pleasure to work on.  Overall, there is plenty to enjoy about this, with varying levels of difficulty within.A large portion of the puzzle has similar shades of greens and blues.  Distinguishing between these shades in the bushes, trees, and rock faces is challenging, but not so much that I ever felt frustrated. I did need to complete those portions in bright light to discern the details in the pieces.  There was not a huge variation of shapes of the pieces.  The same six or seven shapes made up the majority.  You have to be careful because many pieces look similar at first glance, and the wrong piece can appear to fit correctly in another piece's position.  Pieces did not always interlock tightly when in the correct positions.  As others have noted, it doesn't take much to knock pieces out of place.There is a wide variety of colors.  Sometimes a large piece of sky can be boring....not so in this case.  The sky in this puzzle has an extraordinary color palette with colors flowing in a type of ombre symphony.The rose bushes are pretty easy to complete.  Pinks, whites, and lilacs are mostly grouped together.  There are numerous grass colors and textures. Again, they are grouped so that those sections can be completed with a little attention to detail.The main house has numerous colors.  The two horse and carriage combinations are also bright and cheerful, providing excellent punches of color.A tremendous bonus to the Buffalo Games puzzles is the poster which is included with each.  What a fabulous asset.  The poster allowed me to put the puzzle together without using reading glasses.  Although I won't hang the poster, it is nice enough that some people may choose to hang it.The pieces are a nice weight and dust was minimal. The surfaces are nicely finished and the completed puzzle looks good enough to display.Overall, I definitely recommend this puzzle for hours of fun!\n"", ""This puzzle was extremely hard! Beware...all the pieces are the same shape and size, and colors are so similar. It's basically a nightmare. If you like nightmares...you'll love this puzzle.  I personally hated it but my dad loved it, but took him forever to finish! :)\n"", 'Great image. Fun to put together. Pieces are of high quality cardboard and the image was smooth and easy to see. The picture on the box was easy to see and matched the puzzle pieces. The only drawback was that the pieces don’t fit tightly together. So moving the puzzle slightly caused many pieces to move and come apart.\n', 'I am a big fan of Charles Wysockie. I used to do his art in cross stitch and I buy his wall calendar every year. I was looking for something else to do and came across puzzles. I had never seen this particular picture and was surprised when I saw it was don by CW. It was a bit of a challenge. Between the mountains, the sky and all the dark pieces that never seemed to fit anywhere I finally got it all together in about two weeks. The kicker is that with all the reviews that talk about missing pieces, I had two extra that were not from this puzzle. All in all, I enjoyed doing this puzzle. I do think the maker of these puzzles should sharpen their blades, many pieces were not cut all the way through. Not a big deal, but a minor annoyance.\n', ""Unfortunately, this puzzle was once again a huge disappointment.  I bought three of them and still didn't have all the edge pieces.  I really enjoy a good jigsaw puzzle, but every one I have ever purchased from Buffalo Games was incomplete.  Too bad, because the Charles Wysocki puzzles were my special favorites.  I won't be wasting any more time or money buying these puzzles anymore.\n"", 'My wife & I own & have built almost 50 Charles Wysocki 1000 piece puzzles manufactured from about 1980 to today. Seeing ""Moonlight & Roses"" (a pun on Moonlight & Rosie\'s Restaurant) on the box cover and on Amazon on-line, I had no interest in this puzzle since it deceptively appeared to be a painting not in his usual style. It was one of the only ones we did not own and when the price fell temptingly low I purchased it. Much to our surprise the scene is very detailed and fully within the usual style of Wysocki. It was interesting & fun to build & moderately difficulty, all things I had misjudged from the small illustrations I had seen.

7,White Mountain Puzzles Readers Paradise - 1000 Piece Jigsaw Puzzle,264 customer reviews,"[""This is my first puzzle by White Mountain Puzzles.  I'll start with the good.1). It is an interesting/ appealing image.2) MOST of the image is crisp and easily identifiable where it goes.  Oddly, most of my problem with the in focus/ out of focus were the parts of the image that were TOO in focus (See con #1)3)The pieces when assembled make a good secure fit. I mean I literally held the puzzle up in the air like a poster board and none of the pieces fall off.4) The pieces are kind of grid cut but not in a cookie cutter fashion... if that makes sense. This leads to a very enjoyable puzzling experience.The bad....1) though the image is interesting/ appealing.... You can tell that much of the image is photoshopped into the picture.  The lanterns in the hallway are supposed to be behind the bannisters, but they partially overlap.  The stacks of books are perfectly crisp and in focus, but the floor or wall the are supposed to be on is blurred as it is out of focus (the stacks of books would be just as out of focus if they are in the same place as what they are on).2) The puzzle fit so tightly that sometimes you felt you were forcing pieces together more so than them just fitting together.  And it took almost 10 mins to disassemble the puzzle to ensure I didn't damage the pieces and that I got all the pieces separated.3) Several of the pieces were bent, or the backer was partially torn out of the box.  I suspect this goes right back to the tight fit that the pieces make, but it it's new I'd like it to feel that way.All in all, I'm splitting hairs on the cons.  All the pieces were there, the experience was enjoyable.... all in all, I'm a fan of this puzzle.\n"", 'Ive never had any issues with white mountain puzzles but there were 2 pieces missing and while many may think I lost them, I am a super puzzle nerd and the room I do my puzzles in are like a fortress to prevent anyone from messing with them.  The fact of the matter is that I now have to purchase this puzzle again because there were 2 pieces missing and that is more than unpleasant!\n', 'This quality of this puzzle is absolute garbage. I just received this today and many pieces are bent and all of them are frayed on the ends. The only positive is it looks like a challenging puzzle.\n', ""This puzzle is not of the quality we are accustomed to with White Cottage puzzles. It is thinner...20+ pieces were bent and crinkled right out of the box. The pieces as a whole do not fit well together or lay totally flat as though something was off with the stamping/cutting process. Definitely not worth the money!Two of the pics below show just 3 of 20+ bent pieces. The pic of several pieces together only has 1 bent piece but it's easy to see the pieces do not lay flat.\n"", 'Well, first, the good — and only good— all pieces were accounted for and precision cut.  That about covers what we have to say on the good side of this puzzle.  After we received the puzzle and started to put it together, shameful, but then we read the reviews.  We have done many WM puzzles and have never been disappointed as we were with this one.  Upon our reading of the reviews - one dated by Jonny5 over a year ago — well, we couldn’t only agree more with his assessment.  And may we elaborate:  The pieces of this puzzle are totally out of focus, making for some very strainous hours — so don’t buy it if you have sight issues.  While the pieces were precion cut - they must have been done in a room with no A/C and high humidity.  All the pieces were very tough to put together (as in you will have to use force to piece this one together) as a result of the cardboard backing being swollen. And Johnny5 was correct that it was a real chore to take it apart for that same reason.  I am really surprised that WM didn’t correct this issue after hearing a very sound critique of this product - and/or pull this POS from their offerings.  It’s not up to their standards and we have done quite a few of theirs— we will shop elsewhere if this is what we can expect.\n', ""We usually really like White Mountain puzzles but this one was just okay.  It's a cute picture but many of the pieces are weirdly shaped and one particular shape all had a bend in the middle like the saw wouldn't let them go or something.  Next time I will make sure I don't get one that says it has larger pieces.  The puzzle went really fast- maybe 3 or 4 hours with between 1 and 4 people working on it at a time.\n"", 'Many pieces were bent, almost to the point of breaking in half.  I finished the puzzle.  I love the picture...but I was then disappointed because I was missing 2 pieces!  I could not put it into a poster frame, which I was hoping to do.  This was my first White Mountain puzzle.  It was not good quality.\n', ""At Christmas time our living room is a place you pick your way through slowly and with care. It's not a big room to begin with and with four different doorways, two couches, a coffee table, an armchair, an electric keyboard and a scattering of chairs and footstools, it's hardly spacious. Add a Christmas tree and seven or eight people's bags of presents, plus a teen napping on the hearth in front of the fire, and you'd think you'd reached maximum. But no! Put a table in the last few square feet in the center of the room, drag the floor lamps to it, and surround it with people chatting and placing puzzle pieces--now only the cat can get through the room easily.The 1000 piece puzzle is an annual tradition. This one was finished the second day. It got lots of favorable reviews.\n"", 'Such a fun puzzle! It was like four or five challenging puzzles in one. And I love the variety of piece shapes. A few of the longer, thin pieces were slightly bent when I opened the package but otherwise great quality. The only guide is the box top...no poster sized guide...which I actually prefer because it adds to the challenge.\n', 'Excellent puzzle.  It is well made, the pieces fit quite well and there where no missing pieces.  The picture was quite nice and as far as difficulty goes my wife and I would give this one a 7 from a scale of 1 through 10.The pieces have a nice satisfying snap when placed which I liked.We will be purchasing more of this brand.  We found that with PRIME the cost here is quite effective and you certainly get a better selection on Amazon than you do in our local hobby stores.This one (now that it has been completed) will be donated to a local long term care facility, some thing we encourage all to do as there is a need.\n', ""I've recently started doing these puzzles after seeing a movie about a woman that started doing them and entered a contest.

I just bought two more from another company, White Mountain (no insert just box top picture).  The pieces are larger (same amount of puzzle pieces as other ones), which I like, but I just spread it out on my table and noticed that 15 to 20% of the pieces had a problem with their backing.  It is tearing off and not cut correctly in whatever process they use to separate the pieces.  Parts of the holes still have paper attached to them, making it necessary to cut it out myself.  Some of the pieces won't sit flat on the table, which will probably make it difficult to do the puzzle.  Also, some of the pieces were still together when I opened it and don't seem like an exact match together at the edges, which was always the case with the other puzzles I did.

The group of puzzles I\'ve tried by Bush have been quite entertaining. I will admit, I first picked up a couple only because of the value pricing, but, I have enjoyed each one.As usual, this puzzle has the key Buffalo Games traits: - Full-size poster for the squinty-eyed (such as myself) - Clean manufacturing providing properly cut edges and snug fit. - Low puzzle dust is a must. Buffalo is the best at this!The ""how I solved it"" section:I thought this puzzle would be a challenge of sorts due to its mainly blue on blue feel. After the chairs and fire are done (\'natch), it\'s basically shades. So. Palm trees and grass next. Green ocean. Wavy ocean. Purple-shadow coast and then the sky.Another fun puzzle from Bush and Buffalo. Definitely worth owning.\n', 'I find that the pieces even when perfectly matched are not tight so it makes it hard to move a connected section around.\n', 'This is a well constructed puzzle, definitely tougher because of the similarities of so many of the colors but it looks beautiful so far!

Instead, the box lids came glued together and the pieces were loose in the box. The glue was easy to break and I don't think any pieces could have fallen out, and it's of course environmentally friendly. You may notice a piece is missing in my photo but I think I lost that one myself. Every puzzle maker should package like this.The puzzle itself was fun but not unreasonably difficult. It came with a poster of the image so you don't have to keep referring to the lid. My only issue is that some of the pieces can fit perfectly in the wrong spot. But then I guess you can just make up your own weird picture. And when completed, the beautiful picture makes you feel like you're right inside your rich friends' Instagram stories.\n"", ""Darrell Bush's paintings are so relaxing and so vivid.

This is a puzzle we’ll enjoy again and again!\n', 'Fun puzzle with lots of colors and patterns to keep it interesting. No complaints about quality.

This puzzle was cut so that pieces fit perfectly together that shouldn't match.  This makes the puzzle so frustrating because you have to keep taking it apart when pieces fit together, but don't actually go together.\n"", ""You can't go wrong with puzzles by Buffalo Games; the puzzle pieces are quality, allowing you to re-work them which saves money.  Also, Buffalo Games includes a poster -- in this box, we got lucky and found TWO posters, so we each had one to use while working the puzzle together.  Sweet!  We like puzzle artist Darrell Bush.  This was a fun puzzle to work.  Recommend it.\n"", 'I left this puzzle for last in my recent batch of Amazon jigsaw puzzles that feed my jigsaw mania. Originally, when I looked at it and the blended colors, I thought this would be a really hard puzzle.It turned out to be a medium. Some straightforward puzzling and a few ""battle areas"" (notably the lodge roof and the sky).I have had great satisfaction from Buffalo Games puzzles in general and Darrel Bush images in particular. A short primer on Buffalo: - Great image transfer - Superb machining - Full-size poster - Low puzzle dustThe ""how I solved it"" section:Okay, obviously, go for the red door first. That\'s your basic no-brainer. While I was at it, I fished out all the ""yellow"" (front of lodge and fire). Next I went for the flowers and boats. Then the lake. And then, stuff...just...slowed....down. I tackled the path and floor and then ""built up"" from the far away lodge and silhouetted trees. Finally, the sky.Fun puzzle, decent difficulty and Buffalo quality. A good time for the serious puzzler.\n', ""My husband and I puzzle a lot of evenings, and I've become a fan of Darrell Bush as well as the manufacturer of this puzzle. We love that it comes with a poster so that two of us can be looking at the picture at once, the pieces are sturdy and lock together well (although it's tricky! you must look at the detail), and the price was right (we do a lot of puzzles).There are some tough sections in this puzzle (specifically the sky), but we felt accomplished when we finished.\n"", ""I bought this puzzle and another by the same maker.  I like the picture on it, but the pieces arrived with several of them bent and peeling up.  The puzzle pieces do not vary much, so many of the same size pieces fit in the same place.

15,Buffalo Games - Charles Wysocki - Olde Buck's County - 1000 Piece Jigsaw Puzzle,129 customer reviews,"['I am in the midst of a severe jigsaw puzzle addiction. This means ordering multiple puzzles from multiple places, though Amazon is still leading the pack.It also means occasionally picking up puzzles outside my normal interest areas. Most of these tend to be ""on sale"" items and thus hard for my mania to resist.Generally, placid scenes such as this puzzle and oil paintings overall are not on my desired list of jigsaws to work. Given that, this is still a solid jigsaw with the usual great Buffalo Games features: - It has very low puzzle dust content. Even more remarkable when you consider the pieces are loose in the box. - The full-size poster. Oh, for my beady little eyes, such a thing is so needed after all those hours staring at those tiny pieces - The pieces are nicely snug. I can pick up small areas of the puzzle and move them without it crumbling in my hands. - No tricks. This is a strong advantage of the ""standard"" Buffalo puzzles - no odd piece sizes to confound you. - Superb machining. No excess backing, no pieces stuck together. A nice clean puzzle.As I like to do in my reviews, a little primer on how I ""solved"" this jigsaw. After the obligatory border, I went for the water first (that includes the water wheel). Then I went for the white areas (sky and homes). Then it was just futzing around with items (signs, pumpkins, etc.) and finally, fill in the blanks. Done and done. A easy-to-medium level puzzle.Buffalo Games continues to be my favorite puzzle maker. They do so many things right and the only thing I could possibly quibble with has pros to it, too: the little box. Those monster Ravensburger boxes leave a lot of room to sift. The little Buffalo boxes are more problematical. On the other hand, they also take up less space for storage, so...Either way, even with a ""less desired"" puzzle like this one, it\'s an enjoyable and satisfying time.\n', ""When you order puzzles you don't necessarily put them together right away.  The puzzle I received on April 23 wasn't put together until June, past return date.  It was missing three edge pieces.  It looks like the puzzle pieces stuck to the cutting machine and weren't put in the box.  I ordered four puzzles at the time.  The first one had to be returned because the poster was missing from inside.  We still have two more to put together.  Let's just hope all pieces are there!  I learned my lesson.  Either put them together right away or only order one at a time.  I tried to save on shipping by ordering four at once.  Don't make the same mistake I did!\n"", ""I've purchased more than 20 jigsaw puzzles in the last year, most of them here on Amazon. I always read the reviews that complain about missing pieces, but I have never had a legitimate missing piece until this puzzle. Big piece right in the middle is missing, no question about it. Not lost on my end either, 100% sure of that. Other than that, it's a great puzzle. A little on the difficult side but that's fine. This image is Wysocki at his best imo. Yes, a lot of the pieces are very similar and it's easy to put one wrong unless you remember that it's a gridcut so the length of the edges have to match exactly.This is my first Buffalo Games puzzle, and I noticed that the pieces were loose in the box instead of being inside plastic. Not sure if that's standard with theirs, but I'd preferred the pieces came in a plastic bag. The pieces are well made and satisfyingly thick, not quite as thick as a Ravensburger but much thicker than a Ceaco or even a White Mountain.\n"", ""Poster was not included in the box.  The main reason I order Buffalo is because with the poster, I don't have to use a magnifying glass on those small little pictures on the front of the box.  Tried to do a return but opened the box a few days late of the return date.  Very disappointed!\n"", 'Very disappointed in puzzle.  Will not purchase Buffalo Games puzzles in future, and have cancelled order of another on the way.  After several searching of individual pieces from three adults three edge pieces were missing, which questions that others may be missing also?  The  box arrived glued closed but not in plastic covering and pieces were loose in box, no plastic bag.  Have purchased other brands in the last year, in plastic bags, but none were missing any pieces..I do puzzles as a hobby and am sorry as the artist is excellent!\n', ""I'm an old hand at jig-saw puzzles and am a pretty patient guy.  But I found this one too tedious to complete.  The pieces are too uniform in both shape and patterns, and this made it very boring and frustrating to me.  It is often difficult to tell if you've matched the pieces correctly.  Granted, I like a puzzle that I can complete in one or maybe two weeks in my spare time.  I like puzzles whose most pieces give you a decent hint where they belong on the picture.  This is not that kind of puzzle.\n"", ""I've purchased a few puzzles from Buffalo Games with this artist's illustrations and I love them! The paintings are so pretty and they have so many little details. It makes solving them that much more fun. I've gotten three now, and posters have been included with all of them as the boxes are pretty small and it would be difficult to just go by the box top as a guide. I definitely plan to get more and will make my way through the Charles Wysocki collection. I highly recommend these.\n"", ""This is a nice puzzle with quality pieces, but it's one of those frustrating puzzles where the pieces seem to fit even though they're not in the right spot. It sure would help to have a larger picture to compare against, but my puzzle did not come with the poster that's promised on the box. Disappointing!\n"", 'I really enjoyed this puzzle. This Wysocki had a bit more of a challenge in a few places than the other Wysockis I have done.  The pieces in Buffalo Games puzzles fit together well  and will last through multiple reuses. They are a good buy for the money.  Solid product. I am a Ravensburger fan;  the quality of their pieces is top-notch.  But if you do puzzles all the time as we do, you get more bang for the buck with the Buffalo games.\n', ""I HAVE ORDERED AND DONE LOTS OF WYSOCKI PUZZLES FROM AMAZON.

I thought that with all the detail in the picture that it would work for us.  My husband will no longer try it, the pieces are of such a similar shape that his has trouble thinking that a piece goes but so do several other.Like I said not an expert but the previous 1000 puzzle was much more satisfying, it didn’t have as much detail in the picture but the shapes were varied.\n', 'I have been doing jigsaw puzzles many years since I was a child. The last several years, I have only done puzzles on line. I am currently working on this ""huge"" puzzle -- about 2/3rds done. Great adventure!

This one is the perfect example of that.\n"", 'Buffalo Games makes very high quality jigsaw puzzles. No bent or stuck together pieces, and almost no dust. Charles Wysocki art is a great subject, and I really enjoy doing these. The included poster is a big help.\n', 'There are many clues to get started and quite a few challenging areas. Unfortunately, two missing pieces was very disappointing so I probably will never rework the puzzle which I often do when I enjoy the picture.

His artwork is intricate, clever and engaging (and love looking to see if there are more than one or two obvious American flags).  These puzzles have never failed to challenge me (and sometimes friends who join in with me) and entertain.\n', 'This puzzle was pretty fun and relaxing to work on - though its 1000 pieces it has a bunch of different ""landmarks"" and noticeable objects to work on that make the puzzle move along while you try to figure out some of the more ambiguous chunks of the image.\n', 'I do these puzzles at my work with my coworkers. I bought two and both had all their pieces and were awesome quality for the price.  Way nicer AND cheaper than the ones sold in Barnes and Noble.\n', 'The Charles Wysocki puzzles have beautiful, vibrant pictures and the pieces are very well cut to fit perfectly.  I like the small box they come in.  It makes it easy to store a bunch of them in a small space.\n', 'This was a difficult puzzle to complete.  Multiple times we found that we had misassembled the pieces (e.g. water at the bottom, flowers) and had to take the pieces out and reassemble them.We do like that the puzzle has a larger printout of the puzzle.

The challenge I could have done without has been mentioned by other reviewers: several areas of the puzzle, where the pattern is mostly unbroken (handles of hanging tools, strip of right door, top of doorway frame come to mind)  have pieces that can fit together multiple ways, and you don't know you have it wrong (or where) until other sections of the puzzle don't line up. Then it becomes a tedious trial-and-error until everything fits together. The puzzle is challenging enough (in a good way) without adding this frustration. I don't regret purchasing the puzzle. Now that I'm aware of the wonky areas, I might even put it together a second time -- after a cooling off period.\n"", 'Aimee Stewart is my favorite artist! This puzzle is adorable.

The one potential drawback was that all of the sea water was going to drag down the puzzle completion process.

19,Buffalo Games - Vivid Collection - Butterflies - 1000 Piece Jigsaw Puzzle,157 customer reviews,"['This puzzle was reasonably easy to piece together, which was just what I was looking for after a couple of brain-melters.The bright colors appealed to me after a puzzle that was entirely gray-scale. It took me a little bit to get into the swing of this puzzle. My ""go-to"" is to work a single area of significance and move on, but I soon found it better to work on three or four butterflies at once.Around midway, I hit ""the zone"", that wonderful point where I began recognizing the pieces and places without having to look at the box each time. Then it was just slowing myself down so I didn\'t finish too soon.I like that the puzzle comes with a poster to look at (though a wee bit unwieldy). And, of course, the best part is finding all the pieces are there when you\'re done.A couple of drawbacks from a full 5-star: - quite a few pieces were together in 2-piece combinations. Not terrible, but I had to break them apart and reshuffle. - Speaking of the pieces, there were very few ""uniques"". This made for a less exciting building experience - The box cover has a silly puzzle piece obscuring part of the puzzle. The box cover is the perfect size for holding while working the puzzle. It\'s only a tiny area, but who came up with that idea?\n', 'I just finished putting together this puzzle.  The colors really are vivid, just like the title states.  I found the puzzle to be challenging, but not so much that I ever felt frustrated. Since I recently had two different puzzles turn out to have one missing piece each, I decided to count the number of pieces in this puzzle before starting.  This puzzle has more than 1000 pieces.  First, I counted 1014.  Second count was 1015.  Luckily, that count included all the pieces needed.  I thought some would be left over, but all were required for completion.A tremendous bonus to the Buffalo Games puzzles is the poster which is included with each.  What a fabulous asset!  The poster allowed me to put the puzzle together without using reading glasses.  It is nice enough that some people may choose to hang it.The butterflies are beautiful.  There are several of each color.  Within one color story, the edges and pattern details are different enough to distinguish amongst the individual butterflies with a little work.  Many butterflies overlap, increasing difficulty.  The background has interesting colors and smaller, muted butterfly patterns also.  This contributes to making the solution fun and addicting.  I hated having to stop each day.  It took me four days to complete.The pieces are a nice weight and edges are crisp.  Dust was minimal.  There was not a huge variation in shapes of the pieces.  The same seven or eight shapes made up the majority.  Pieces interlocked tightly when in the correct positions.  The surfaces are nicely finished and the completed puzzle looks good enough to display.  I definitely recommend this puzzle.\n', 'Great puzzle.  My granddaughter and I made it together and loved it.  Pieces fit together well enough to move around completed sections.  Considering how poorly some puzzles are made these days, I have never been disappointed by a Buffalo Games puzzle.  Two thumbs up!\n', 'I loved the brilliant colors and the high quality of the pieces, all of which were perfect.  I also have the Buffalo Games hot-air balloons puzzle, which was a tiny bit easier because the shapes were larger.  The level of difficulty of this puzzle was perfect  for me:  difficult, but not impossible.  I define ""impossible"" as: once the perimeter is in place, stare at the puzzle for 15 minutes before finding the very first piece to insert (hey, I remember working ""Snow White Without the Seven Dwarfs"" in the 1970\'s).  Here, though, after 15 minutes I probably had 5 pieces in place around the perimeter and had also started assembling butterflies.  I enjoyed it!\n', ""This puzzle was so much fun.  We have purchased several photos in this same Vivid Collection and they're tons of fun!  It is a challenging puzzle that can be done easily by putting together one butterfly at a time, based on the coloring of each.  My husband and I spent about 3 days putting this one together.\n"", ""As a puzzler for over 40 yrs this is probably one of the most challenging puzzles I have ever done. All the different colors and shapes of butterflies make this puzzle difficult, they're alike in many ways, making it hard to finish\n"", 'Working this puzzle in my spare time took me almost two weeks to sort the pieces which I did by dividing into 6 sections (this was made easier by using the poster provided which was folded into sixths) and once done, quickly finished in two evenings. Colors are true to the picture, pieces are pretty sturdy and fit together well. Other brands make their puzzles thicker but I didn’t have any issues with the thinner pieces of this puzzle.\n', 'This puzzle has beautiful colors. The pieces have crisp edges and fit together well. There was minimal dust.This was a great way to gather a few people and work together. This was also a great way for some solo puzzle working. The puzzle was a great way to let go of some stress with some stress-free concentration.We are already working on our second puzzle from Buffalo Games and Puzzles.I highly recommend Buffalo Games and Puzzles for quality products and great customer service. Thank you for the super fast shipping!\n', 'Love love love this puzzle. This was my first Buffalo puzzle, and I was impressed with the quality. I was very confused by the zig-zag pieces at first, and many pieces that “fit” but don’t “belong.” But the vibrant colors and unique butterfly patterns made it very enjoyable!\n', 'No poster in mine. Manufacturer had to send one. Am STILL looking for all the \'edge\' pieces. I\'ve dumped them out THREE times and even looked PIECE BY PIECE, but can\'t find about five of them.

Still....I\'ve sorted them ONE BY ONE! Hmmmmm....It\'s  beautiful photo. Gorgeous colors. I can tell it\'s going to be a difficult puzzle. Which doesn\'t bother me. But I\'m concerned about the missing pieces! We\'ll see.\n', ""This is a beautiful, frame-worthy puzzle, with vivid colors and great detailing.  However, after assembling the entire puzzle, I only then discovered that THREE pieces were missing.  Two were in very obvious areas and the other was an edge piece.  If I had wanted a puzzle with missing pieces, I could have spent a few bucks at the local thrift store.  So I'm impressed with the quality of the construction and the art work, I am not impressed with the level of quality control...\n"", 'Loved the puzzle, very challeging!!!  But there were three pieces missing. I love doing puzzles, but I have had anywhere from 1 to 7 pieces missing.  That is really heartbreaking.\n', 'I liked this puzzle. The pieces fit well, the colors were vibrant, sometimes challenging to figure out which piece went to which butterfly so there was thinking involved, but not so much so that the exercise became work rather than involved enjoyment. I also really liked that the box was small, just enough to fit the pieces + the poster-sized foldout of the finished picture.\n', 'Love Buffalo Games jigsaw puzzles because the pieces are thick and almost click into place.  I like the subjects of the pictures which are challenging and rewarding.  I have purchased 5 of their puzzles.  Great gifts too.\n', 'I am an avid puzzler. This puzzle was a lot of fun to put together and the pieces were so vivid and beautiful that they were like pieces of art all on their own. Most of the Buffalo puzzles tend to come with a large poster (which I love!) that comes in handy when multiple people are working the puzzle. The pieces are a bit shiny but not so much that there was a glare under the lights.\n', 'Love these puzzles. Quality pictures and not flimsy pieces like cheap puzzles. This picture is easily suitable for framing if you like butterflies - very pretty.\n', ""This puzzle was perfect.

Most likely reason, the peices are stuck in the cutter and never placed in the box. Very disappointing.\n', 'I had fun putting this puzzle together and I had every piece. My toddler was the difficulty with putting it together as he would get pieces and throw them. Even with that I managed to have a complete puzzle in the end. I will be gluing it and framing it for my home. Very beautiful and pieces were not too difficult to find the right placement. Two pieces out of the whole puzzle were very snug even though they were in the right place. The puzzle was not lose once it was all put together. Very satisfied.\n', 'I liked that this puzzle was so challenging. I disliked that this puzzle was so challenging. I thought for sure there were missing pieces and I felt like giving up.  It was very satisfying when I placed that last piece.  So if you like hard puzzles, you will like this. I hated dismantleing it.\n', ""Fun puzzle with moderate difficulty.  Really like Buffalo Games Puzzles as the pieces are fairly unique and don't have wrong placement issue.  Also really like the big picture they send with the puzzle.  I now have about a dozen of their puzzles.\n"", 'I wanted to love this Buffalo brand, since they have nice pictures. Pieces are thick and sturdy; however, they don’t fit together as tightly as I’d like. I like the helpful large poster inside! Packaging is frustrating though (box glued; pieces inside are loose). Compared to dollar store cheap puzzles, it’s great overall! But I think I’ll stick with White Mountain or Ravensburger.\n', 'My grand daughter is a puzzle junkie, and she loves this puzzle.  Extremely well constructed and gorgeous.  I really like that is is made in the USA.  I have bought three more Buffalo game puzzles.  I am a fan.\n', 'Challenging puzzle, which was great!Downside is, when I got down to the last 2 pieces, they did not fit anywhere in the puzzle,and there were two pieces missing in the “completed” puzzle.  How disappointing, after all that effort.\n', 'Enjoyed doing this puzzle.  The challenge definitely was there since many of the puzzle pieces could not be easily grouped into specific color groupings.\n', ""I order Buffalo Puzzles because the pieces are solid and thicker than most jigsaw puzzle companies.

22,Buffalo Games - Charles Wysocki - Root Beer Break At the Butterfield's - 1000 Piece Jigsaw Puzzle,26 customer reviews,"['This puzzle was harder than most of the Charles Wysocki puzzles because of the vast amount of sand and sky.

23,Buffalo Games - Aimee Stewart - Beach Vacation - 1000 Piece Jigsaw Puzzle,37 customer reviews,"['Coming soon after a surprisingly low quality Buffalo Games puzzle, I was delighted to see that it was only an aberration. This puzzle is back up to the standards I\'ve come to expect from Buffalo Games.Specifically, here\'s what you usually get from a Buffalo Games puzzle: - Excellent machining - few pieces (if any) stuck together and no excess material. - Tight-fitting pieces - critical. Allows you to work small sections and move them without it falling apart. - Full-size poster - easy on the eyes. - Crisp image transfer - bright and clean. - Low puzzle dust - a must!The ""how I solved it"" section:So, the station wagon made the most sense to me as a starter. At this point, I also grabbed all purple pieces for later work. Then I decided the water and sky offered the best ""unique"" color area to work. Coming back in, I grabbed all those purple pieces and sort of assembled those areas. Following that, it was just filling in as needed.Fun puzzle with lots to do and colorful, a trademark of the Aimee Stewart series. And, traditional Buffalo Games quality. Glad to be back!\n', ""The box shows 4 points where the box lid is glued to the box, 2 on each of 2 sides. But in fact they glue all 4 sides, and use way too much glue. Even with a knife, it's a struggle to open the box without damaging it. This has been true with all of their puzzles I have purchased. Their customer service department wasn't interested in my comments. I wouldn't give them as gifts because of this.\n"", 'This puzzle is very busy, with lots of vibrant colors and different items.  Typical Aimee Stewart who is one of our favorite puzzle artists.  It was challenging, but not too much so.  Love the quality of Buffalo Puzzles; love the enclosed poster.  Will definitely work this puzzle again, because it was fun.\n', 'Fun puzzle! Sturdy pieces, and none were missing! :) Definitely would recommend purchasing! Arrived on time! Happy with my purchase!

So Disappointed!\n', ""This is the 2nd one of these I have - the other is the blue camping trailer. They are fun puzzles to do.
